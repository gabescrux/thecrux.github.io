<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Corrinne Marie, I
remember in high school sitting behind you in many of our classes… and just
adoring you. It was a little creepy…  but I would often wonder if we would ever
be together. Especially considering what a screw ball I am. Of course, not long
after that we were writing secret notes to each other and I finally got the
answer to my question. 8 years ago, when I asked you to be my girlfriend.  I
recall it clearly, because when I asked you, you promptly responded “well you
know my answer, but I have to think about it.” Which, for me, was a lot better
than if you said no and I was game for that. I spent the rest of the day trying
to get you to say yes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We went to college
together, and I asked you to marry me, and you didn’t even give me an answer
that time. You thought I was joking… until I convinced you, it was real, you
said yes to that too and now you’re stuck with me. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In just a moment we both
will be asked a different question… one much more serious than anything I could
ever ask you. Before that, I want you to know who you are to me. You are God’s
masterpiece created in Jesus Christ to do good things, which He has ordained
long ago. You are faithful, disciplined, loving, sacrificial, humble, truthful,
trusting, hopeful, consistent, endearing, captivating, admirable, knowledgeable,
treasurable, precious, priceless, spiritually wealthy, and Godly.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I will always pursue you,
just like Hosea pursued Gomer, and Christ pursued the church. I will Love you
just like Christ Loves the church and gave Himself up for her. The world says
we need Love until it hurts, God says we need to Love until we die. My
faithfulness to you is not superficial I am promising to be with you and only
you for my entire life. No matter what you do or what you say I will Love you
and I will remain faithful to you til death. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I Love you Corrinne Marie
and this is the beginning, the time we serve the Lord together. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>My sweet Gabriel Wesley, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>We’ve been waiting for this day for 8 years! I always
knew that day I saw you down that hallway that we would have something between
us. I never thought that we would one day be saying some of the most important
promises of our lives to each other. But here we are. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>I began to find out how kind-hearted and gentle you
were once we began talking. You’ve always had this love for getting to know
where people are coming from. Even from the beginning when we were just
teenagers, you never failed to put me first. Whether it was picking what movie
we wanted to see or the flavor of ice cream we would share, your love for
putting me first has always shone through. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'> They say your significant other is your better half
and I never understood that until I met you. You make me a better person in
every way. Through each year we’ve been together, we’ve overcome so many
obstacles. From high school, college, vacations, graduation, jobs –we’ve always
come out better. Over the years, people have continually asked me “how are you
so sure that Gabe is the one?” – It’s because you’re the first person I think
of when I wake up and the last one I think of before I fall asleep at night. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>I can’t believe I’m the one who gets to love you. I
can’t believe I’m the one who you chose. I’m forever grateful to your devotion
and careful attention to our relationship. Thank you for always loving me even
during the times I’m not so loveable. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>As your wife, I hope to be many things—but one of them
is not perfect, because I know that we wouldn’t be standing here today without
the growth we’ve made through our imperfections. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> I can promise however to try my best: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>-I promise to love you through everything</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>-I promise to let you drive whenever you
ask </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>-I promise to be your advocate and your
best friend through whatever path the Lord chooses for us </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>-I promise to submit to your leadership
and to be gentle and kind in spirit </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>-I promise to let you roll your clothes
instead of folding them, even if it takes you all year </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>-I promise to let you sing and dance to
any song you want to—even if my face says otherwise </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>-I promise to put God first, you second,
and myself last</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>-and I promise try my best to be half the
person you are</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
