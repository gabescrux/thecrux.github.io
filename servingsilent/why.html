					<p class="pl-3 lead">
							In this age of information there is seemingly no application. Often western Christianity is overflowing with wonderful 
							teaching and exposition, but from my experience there is very few people actually doing what Christ told them to do. 
							With any mandate, there is always a source. 
							As a Christian (Christ follower / Disciple of Christ) God's word is our source. 
							<div class="blockquote-sqr-rgt" style="border-right:solid #e32625 4px;">
									"being a Christian is NOT synonymous with being passive."
							</div>
					</p>
					<p class="pl-3 lead">
							The word is abundantly clear, time tested, and the source of true Love.
							To be honest, being a Christian is NOT synonymous with being passive, having Love and no truth, or even being a spectator. The following passages will
							set the tone for the meaning behind <a  href="index.html"> ServingSilent.com</a>. 
							God charged us to be like His son Jesus, and there is no greater Love and truth than to know Him and make Him known. 
							My encouragement to you, hopefully as a brother in Christ, is that you carefully and genuinely read the verses below and apply them in your walk with the Lord.

				<b>Matthew 28:16-20 </b><br/>Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which 
				Jesus had directed them. And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. And Jesus 
				came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore 
				and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
				 and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, 
				 I am with you always, to the end of the age.

				<b>Romans 10:11-15</b><br/> As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” 
				For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all 
				who call on him, for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”<br/><br/>
				How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in 
				the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? 
				And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”

				<b>2 Timothy 2:24-26</b><br/>The Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.
				 Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, 
				 and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.

			<p class="lead p-3">
				<b>James 1:19-27</b><br/> My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,
				because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires. Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent
				and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. 
				<br/><br/>
				Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
				Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself,
				goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. 25 But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues 
				in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do. 
				<br/><br/>
				Those who consider themselves religious and 
				yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless. Religion that God our Father accepts as 
				pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

				<b>Colossians 1:24-29</b><br/>Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions,
				for the sake of his body, which is the church. I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness— 
				the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s people. To them God has chosen to make known among 
				the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
				<br/><br/>
				He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and
				teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ. 
				To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.

				<b>2 Timothy 3:10-17</b><br/>You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, my persecutions 
				and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra—which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me.
				<br/><br/>
				Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse,
				deceiving and being deceived. But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it 
				and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
				<br/><br/>
				All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
				that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

				<b>Luke 10:17-20</b><br/>The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!” And he said to them, 
				“I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power 
				of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your

				<b>Hebrews 4:12-13</b><br/>For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing 
				soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight.
				Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.

				<b>Ephesians 6:10-18</b><br/>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take
				your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, 
				against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 
				<br/><br/>
				Therefore put on the full armor of 
				God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, 
				with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the 
				readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 
				<br/><br/>
				In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish 
				all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
				And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying 
				for all the Lord’s people.

				<b>1 Thessalonians 5:12-24</b><br/>We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, 
				and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 
				<br/><br/>
				And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle,
				 encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good 
				 to one another and to everyone. Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God 
				 in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies, but test everything; hold fast what is good. Abstain from every form of evil.
				 <br/><br/>
				Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
				He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.

				<b>Psalms 84:10-12</b><br/>Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than

				<b>2 Corinthians 12:9-10</b><br/>"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses,

				For when I am weak, then I am strong.

				<b>2 Timothy 4:16-18</b><br/>At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. But the Lord stood

				from the lion’s mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
